# Full-Stack Contact and CV Submission Application

- **Email Service:** Backend processes the forms, sending the data and attached files as an email.

## Technologies Used

### Front End

- React
- HTML/CSS

### Back End

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Multer (for handling file uploads)
- Nodemailer (for sending emails)

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-directory

2. Install backend dependencies:

cd backend
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

    cd ../frontend
    npm install
```

### Running the Application

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Start the backend server in development mode (with nodemon):
